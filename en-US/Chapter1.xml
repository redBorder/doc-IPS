	<title>Installing the redBorder Enterprise Edition IPS</title>
	<section>
	    <title> Requirements</title>
	    <para> <emphasis role = "bold"> redBorder IPS</emphasis> is a software that needs the following requirements in order to function correctly. The minimum essential elements required for the installation as well as those recommended for correct performance are referenced at every SNORT instance being executed. They are shown in the following table:</para>

		<para> For example, if you want four SNORT instances in the recommended configuration, you need a machine with 16 GB and four cores.</para>

		<title>Obtaining the ISO</title>
		<para> Redborder Enterprise Edition IPS is distributed as an ISO file that can be obtained in different ways. If you don’t have it, please contact our sales team (sales@redborder.com) or our support team (support@redborder.com) to provide you with the last available ISO file or a way to download it.</para>

	<section>
		<title>Burning the ISO Image</title>
		<para> The ISO image is prepared to perform the boot from a DVD reader, USB device or as an ISO file for a virtual machine.</para>
		<para><emphasis role = "bold">NOTE: The process of creating a bootable USB for the IPS installation is the same as for the manager installation. You can find it accessing the support page.</emphasis></para>
		<para>In order to burn the ISO image from a Linux system to a USB device, the following command needs to be used if the USB device is mapped in /dev/sdd:</para>
		<programlisting>[root@machine ~]# dd if=redBorder-3.1.80-11-x86_64-6.5-sensor.iso of=/dev/sdd bs=10M</programlisting>

		<title>Installing the ISO</title>
		<para><emphasis role = "bold">NOTE: If a usb memory is used on a real machine, the operating system will be automatically extending the disk and the data on the usb will be lost. To avoid this, the usb needs to be removed before rebooting.</emphasis></para>
		<para>Once you have booted the redborder ISO, you will see the installation menu. To perform the installation, select the option: Install Sensor IPS:</para>

		<para>Once in the installation process, the user only needs to confirm the installation destination and root password. Redborder is prepared for unattended installations and so you should be especially careful with the time you have to respond to these three questions if you wish to modify the default options:</para>

		<para>Upon completing the installation process, you have two configuration options depending on whether or not there is a DHCP server.</para>

		<para>In both cases you will have to access the system in order to configure and register the sensor in the manager. You will access with the root user and password that was selected during installation.</para>

		<para>To finish the configuration of the management IP, you need to apply the changes. Then you must return to the previous menu (Network configuration menu) and select option “a”.</para>

		<para>When the above processes finish, the management interface will be configured.</para>
		<para>In this section you must keep in mind whether you want an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) or an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS). For the former, you only need a management network interface and another which you will use to analyze traffic. For the latter, in addition to the management interface, you will need two or more network interfaces.</para>
		<para>In this guide we will assume that there are two network interfaces in your system. You have already configured the first in the previous steps and this is the interface that you will use to communicate with the sensor. With the second network interface you are going to create a segment with a listening port to analyze the traffic that flows through the said interface.  Likewise, you need to send the desired traffic to this second interface. One option is to use a network listening device (Network TAP) which will be configured to resend traffic through the interfaces where it has not received traffic (see image). A diagram is included where the configuration can be seen:</para>

        </mediaobject>
		<para>Now select option number 3 for Segment settings.</para>
		<para>If you have a segment with bypass support, this capability will be auto-configured by default when detected. In our case we are going to assume that you don't have bypass support. So, you must select the option "n" (new segment) in order to configure a segment and follow the wizard:</para>
		<orderedlist numeration="lowerroman">
			<listitem>
				<para>Insert segment number (0-1) [0]: Press ENTER to select 0.</para>
			</listitem>
			<listitem>
				<para>Insert segment first port [1]: Press ENTER to select 1.</para>
			</listitem>
			<listitem>
				<para>Assign a second port to the segment (Y/n): Select N and press ENTER.</para>

		<para>After creating the segment, you must apply the changes.</para>
		<para>Lastly you can change, in Network Configuration, the DNS configuration and the desired domain. To do this, you select option 2 -  <emphasis role = "bold">DNS and domain settings</emphasis>:</para>
