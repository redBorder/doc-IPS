		<title>What is an IDS?</title>
		<para><emphasis role="bold">IDS</emphasis> is an Intrusion Detection System in the network to protect one organization.</para> 
		<para>It is a specific software that runs in user space and analyse network traffic (using a mirror port or SPAN) in one system interface or between two interfaces joined as a bridge (software switch).</para>
		<para>The traffic is analyzed for anomalies, specific signatures or suspicious behaviors.</para> 
		<para>The goal of an IDS is <emphasis role="bold">to dectect intrusions and create alerts without interrupting the traffic in the organization.</emphasis></para>
    </section>
    <section>
		<title>What is an IPS?</title>
		<para><emphasis role="bold">IPS</emphasis> is an Intrusion Prevention System that works in the network or networks inside an organization.</para> 
		<para>It works in the same way as an IDS (in fact it normaly uses the same software with an adapted behavior), in this case an IPS can block the traffic in the organization,
		 in that way when an attack is detected the system can choose between 
		 <emphasis role="bold">showing alerts or discard those packets, working in a similar way as a firewall.</emphasis></para>
		 <para>The configuration and registration of the IPS/IDS sensors into the Manager is the next step to the installation one. This process consist in two steps:</para>

	    <title> Requirements</title>
	    <para> <emphasis role = "bold"> redBorder IPS</emphasis> is a software that needs the following requirements in order to function correctly. The minimum essential elements required for the installation as well as those recommended for correct performance are referenced at every SNORT instance being executed. They are shown in the following table:</para>

		<para> For example, if you want four SNORT instances in the recommended configuration, you need a machine with 16 GB and four cores.</para>
                <warning>
                  <title> Warning </title>
                  <para> It is VERY IMPORTANT that the configuration of the Manager (or cluster of managers) is performed before configuring IPS sensors. </para>
                  <para> The Manager must be operational and in a network accessible to the sensors. Some of the sensor configuration processes depend on the access to the Manager. </para>
                </warning>

		<title>Obtaining the ISO</title>
		<para> Redborder Enterprise Edition IPS is distributed as an ISO file that can be obtained in different ways. If you don’t have it, please contact our sales team (sales@redborder.com) or our support team (support@redborder.com) to provide you with the last available ISO file or a way to download it.</para>
	</section>	
	<section>
		<title>Burning the ISO Image</title>
		<para> The ISO image is prepared to perform the boot from a DVD reader, USB device or as an ISO file for a virtual machine.</para>
		<para><emphasis role = "bold">NOTE: The process of creating a bootable USB for the IPS installation is the same as for the manager installation. You can find it accessing the support page.</emphasis></para>
		<para>In order to burn the ISO image from a Linux system to a USB device, the following command needs to be used if the USB device is mapped in /dev/sdd:</para>
		<programlisting>[root@machine ~]# dd if=redBorder-3.1.80-18-x86_64-6.5-sensor.iso of=/dev/sdd bs=10M</programlisting>

		<title>Installing the ISO</title>
		<para><emphasis role = "bold">NOTE: If a usb memory is used on a real machine, the operating system will be automatically extending the disk and the data on the usb will be lost. To avoid this, the usb needs to be removed before rebooting.</emphasis></para>
		<para>Once you have booted the redborder ISO, you will see the installation menu. To perform the installation, select the option: Install Sensor IPS:</para>

		<para>Once in the installation process, the user only needs to confirm the installation destination and root password. Redborder is prepared for unattended installations and so you should be especially careful with the time you have to respond to these three questions if you wish to modify the default options:</para>
